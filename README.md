# JASA: JTL-based framework for Availability analysis of Software Architecture

This repository contains the artifacts created for the paper:
### From Software Architecture to Analysis Models and Back: <br/>Model-Driven Refactoring Aimed at Availability Improvement

The repository folders are organized as follows:
##### GSPN
Contains the GSPN models (both generated from UML and refactored).
Inside `GSPN`, the `ECS-Measures.solution` folder contains the GSPN models in a format that can be directly imported in the [GreatSPN](http://www.di.unito.it/~greatspn/) tool, together with all the artifacts used for the analysis of these models (like reachability graphs and continuous-time Markov chains).
To easily visualize the GSPN models, the main folder also contains PDF files exported from GreatSPN.
##### JTL
Contains the [JTL](https://jtl.univaq.it) project used in the paper. The `metamodels` folder contains the UML and PNML metamodels in the Ecore format. The `models` folder contains the UML and GSPN models in the XMI format. Both models and metamodels can be used within the [Eclipse Modelling Framework](https://www.eclipse.org/modeling/emf/). The `transformations` folder contains the UML<sup>JASA</sup>-GSPN bidirectional transformation.
##### UML
Contains the UML models organized in [Papyrus](https://www.eclipse.org/papyrus/) projects. These projects contain EMF models, their graphical representation in Papyrus and exported images for a more convenient visualization. The `ECS` folder contains the initial UML models, whereas the `ECS_Refactored` contains models generated by JTL by backpropagating the refactoring of the GSPN models.


### The JASA approach
![The JASA approach](/approach.png?raw=true "The JASA overall approach")
The figure shows the JASA overall approach:
1. UML models in the `UML/ECS` folder are given as input to the JTL transformation in the `JTL` folder
2. The JTL transformation generates three GSPN models (ManagingTemperature, MonitoringConditions, and RemoteMonitoring) in the `GSPN` folder
3. The generated GSPN models are refactored using the *Active (AR), Semi-Active (SAR), Passive (PR), and Semi-Passive Replication (SPR)* patterns. The refactored models are stored in the same folder and their filenames contain the acronyms of the applied patterns.
4. The JTL transformation is used again in backward direction to generate a new UML architecture. The resulting models are contained in the `UML/ECS_Refactored` folder.
